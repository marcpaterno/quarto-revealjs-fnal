# Quarto reveal.js template - fnal

This is a quarto template for a Reveal.js presentation.
It is an attempt to model the Fermilab PowerPoint theme.

## Installation

This [Quarto](quarto.org) template can be installed/used using the following command in a directory in which you want to create a new Quarto document:

```bash
quarto use template marcpaterno/quarto-revealjs-fnal
```

The file `example.qmd` shows some of the features of Quarto.

You can create your own Quarto document, using a similar YAML header, by copying `example.qmd` and modifying it.
To view the rendered document, you can use:

```bash
quarto preview <filename>
```

You can also make a static HTML version of your document by using:

```bash
quarto render <filename>
```

There is not at this time a good way to make a PDF version of your document.
