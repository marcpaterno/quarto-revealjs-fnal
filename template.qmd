# Section 1

Only use sections in very long talks.

## A normal slide

Slides can have non-bulleted text.

* They can also have bullet items.
* That only makes sense if you have more than one.

Bulleted and non-bulleted text can be mixed.

:::{.aside}
One can also have *asides*, which should be used sparingly for ancillary thoughts.
